# PhoneManager

## Solution description

PhoneManager is a PoC solution for managing customer's phone numbers.

* `PhoneManager`: .NET Standard 2.0 library to handle business logic.

* `PhoneManager.Api`: .NET Core 2.2 WebApi that allows accessing `PhoneManager` functionality through REST controllers. This is the app you'd like to run to test the code (`dotnet build` and `dotnet run` is enough!).
.NET Core 2.2 SDK is required to compile this project (as well as tests projects).

## Swagger documentation generation

REST APIs OpenApi specification is automatically generated on build and copied to `AutoGeneratedFilesBySwagger` dir using [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore).

When `PhoneManager.Api` project is running, API documentation can be accessed in <project_uri>/swagger/index.html (https://localhost:8002/swagger/index.html by default, configurable in `appsettings.json` file or through environment variables.

That page can be used as to test the api as well.
